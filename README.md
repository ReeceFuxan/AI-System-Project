# AI-Powered Academic Research Paper Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered recommendation system designed to help researchers, students, and academics discover relevant research papers based on their interests and reading history. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, research topics, and citation patterns to provide accurate, personalized recommendations.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests research papers tailored to user preferences and past interactions.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter results by publication year, author, or research domain.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Provides recommendations based on citation analysis and topic modeling.
- **External Integrations:** Connects with major research databases (planned feature).

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11 (or older)
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (TBD)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): spaCy
- Database: PostgreSQL 
- Frontend: JavaFX (for GUI, if applicable)
